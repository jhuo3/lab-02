		<h1>Work Experience</h1>
		<p>While spending my summer break back in Shanghai in the past few years, I have had three internships in which two internships were at consulting companies and the other one was at an asset management company. Through the extensive training and the intensive work environment in consulting company, I have become proficient in data analysis through the use of coding and technical tools, reporting current market benchmarks and trends, and constructing interactive and animated electronic reports for customer use according to their desired criteria. Additionally, during the investment banking internship, I performed due diligence, prepared valuation analysis and client presentations. I have participated in an acquisition deal and an Initial Public Offering in which the transaction values over thirty million dollars.</p>
