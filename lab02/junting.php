			<p>This is Junting Chen, a sophomore in University of Rochester, and I prefer Christy as my English name. I am major in Business and consider minoring in or BA computer science. Therefore, I took CSC 170 last semester for the foundation of CSC 174 this semester. Exploring opportunities during college life is my first goal, including life decisions, career path, and networking.</p>
