			<h1>University</h1>
			
			<p>I managed to get accepted into a great university that I am still currently attending, called the University of Rochester in the state of New York. I was pursuing a Brain and Cognitive Sciences major with the pre-med track when I first started university (solely because of the decisions made by my parents) but I soon realized that I didn’t want to do any of that. I then thought about maybe pursuing a computer science major and then a neuroscience major and then lastly a psychology major. But I didn’t want to do any of those majors because I did not see myself having a career in the fields that those majors represented. Of course, I knew that what I majored in did not absolutely guarantee a certain career path for me, but I just did not see myself in those majors for my time being in the university.</p>
