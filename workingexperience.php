		<h1>Working Experience</h1>
		<p>In terms of working experience, I had internship in AECOM this summer, the architecture counselling company. I worked in Tianjin, China, which is also my hometown. The entire internship lasts about one month, and I worked in Urban Planning Division and followed “Xiaomeisha” project, doing preliminary research, engaging every conference and composing lots of related materials. Since the first day of working, me and my colleagues spared all effort, devoted us in this project. Starting with the preliminary research, I have done the investigation of three collaborative companies, including company information, core staffs and specialists information and other references or sources. Furthermore, me and my colleagues engaged in many meetings to discuss “Xiaomeisha”, as it has special marine need and distinct developing plans. I also participated a training conference about Beijing “Hutong” style architecture with the study of Beijing Nanluoguxiang done. In the conference, we share thoughts to exemplify how to decentralize the tourists to different but nearby areas and how to complete the transformation of relics or old buildings. I have assisted with some supplementary work, such as conference translation, extended research, and document-composing. Additionally, I took in part with client-side negotiating and assistance for some new projects that come to AECOM.</p>
